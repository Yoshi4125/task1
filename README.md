### Description
The BMI Calculator app allows users to quickly and easily calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their height and weight. The app is designed to help individuals monitor their BMI to maintain a healthy lifestyle. It provides instant results and categorizes the BMI into different health ranges such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity.

### Aim
The aim of the BMI Calculator app is to provide an intuitive and user-friendly tool for individuals to assess their BMI. By understanding their BMI, users can make informed decisions about their diet, exercise, and overall health management. The app aims to promote health awareness and encourage users to maintain a healthy weight.

### Algorithm
1. *User Input*:
    - Prompt the user to enter their height (in meters or feet and inches).
    - Prompt the user to enter their weight (in kilograms or pounds).
   
2. *Conversion (if necessary)*:
    - If height is given in feet and inches, convert it to meters.
    - If weight is given in pounds, convert it to kilograms.

3. *BMI Calculation*:
    - Use the formula: \( \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{weight (kg)}}{\text{height (m)}^2} \).

4. *BMI Classification*:
    - Underweight: BMI < 18.5
    - Normal weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9
    - Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 29.9
    - Obesity: BMI ≥ 30

5. *Output*:
    - Display the calculated BMI.
    - Display the BMI category.

### Result
The result of using the BMI Calculator app is an instant display of the user's BMI value along with a classification of their BMI range. This information can help users understand their current health status and take appropriate actions to maintain or improve their health.
